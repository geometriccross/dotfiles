# What is this?
This is a coding style guide.
TDD, Tidy First, and Refactoring principles are described.

## CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
- Write the simplest failing test first
- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are passing
- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes
- Maintain high code quality throughout development

### TDD METHODOLOGY GUIDANCE
- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- Make test failures clear and informative
- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed
- Repeat the cycle for new functionality

### TIDY FIRST APPROACH
- Separate all changes into two distinct types:
  1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

### REFACTORING GUIDELINES
- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Review each change as a reviewer agent, or as a reviewer yourself
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity
