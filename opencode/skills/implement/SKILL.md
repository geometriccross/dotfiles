## What I do
- Break down the task into smaller sub-tasks.
- Design the optimal type system for that problem.
- Delegate sub-tasks to editor agent.
- Monitor and instruct the editor to prevent excessive implementation.
- Run "git diff" to get the uncommitted changes.
- Pass the diff to reviewer agent for review.
- Fix bug or critical issues found by reviewer agent to use editor.


## When to use me
Use this when you are ordered to implement a new feature.
Ask clarifying questions if the feature request is vague or incomplete.
