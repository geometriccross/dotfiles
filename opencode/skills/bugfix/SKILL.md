## What I do
Use `beads` for managing tasks and subtasks.
Before starting implementation, break down the feature into smaller sub-tasks.
Refer past beads tasks for similar features to maintain consistency.

1. You need to understand the issue, read the codebase, and comprehend what is happening.
2. Check the test cases related to the bug.
3. Please decide on the direction for correction.
4. Use `editor` to fix the bug.
5. Use `reviewer` to review the fix.
6. run the tests to ensure the bug is fixed. if bug was not fixed, go back to step 1


## When to use me
Use this when you are ordered to fix a bug or an issue.
Ask clarifying questions if the feature request is vague or incomplete.
