## What I do
You need to understand the issue, read the codebase, and comprehend what is happening.
Next, tell the sub-agent what's wrong and have them fix it.


## When to use me
Use this when you are ordered to fix a bug or an issue.
Ask clarifying questions if the feature request is vague or incomplete.
